# slsn-data
Explore the classifications export CSV from the SLSN project.

1. Download a classifications export from the [SLSN data exports page](https://www.zooniverse.org/lab/10996/data-exports).
1. Commit to this repo as `site/_data/classifications.csv`.
1. Push to the main branch and wait for GitHub Pages to rebuild the site with the new export. It takes a couple of minutes.
1. Every subject has a URL like: `{site-root}/subjects/{subject-ID}`.

Classification exports are too large to be stored on GitHub, so they are committed and stored with [GitHub Large File Storage](https://git-lfs.com/). Make sure you have `git-lfs` installed in order to work with this repo.
